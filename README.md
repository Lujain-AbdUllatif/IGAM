<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
WE introduce our app about delivered and assigned packages to locations to unknowing areas in Negev. In negev there are a lot of small villages that it is unknowing from others.
This villages in needs situation, that they a have a lot of problems that we decide to solve in this app.
Examples about the problems in this villages:
- Poor connection.
- Unknown locations.
- Unknown families in need.
- Unknown how to delivered.

 In this project we success to introduce the people in need an easy app to use, and for agents to know peoples in nedd and there families, that there a lot of families that didn't know the agent in there location.
 Also in this app we can help agent to know how many packages that delivered and assigned from different families in different areas. in  every location there are an agent to know families in need and there locations in his area. also the agent can know how many packages he has in his location to allow him to delivered, and the agent can know how many packages assigned in his location and manage them.
 In addition to that there are "Add" feature, that allow to add new agent, new family and new location.
 
 In this app we have one critical problem that in unknown villages in "Negev" there are "poor connection" to the Internet, this problem doesn't allow families in need to this helpful app.
