# IGAM
IGAM is a simple packagesâ€™ management especially made for association, the idea was raised first due to the management problem the emergency room faced with delivering packages to the unrecognised villages in Negev.  
The web-application provides the necessary connection between the administrators and the agents working to deliver the packages to the families living in these unrecognised villages, it also provides the necessary documentation for the packages delivery. The application manages the dilevery is all aspects starting by assiging the packages to the families and the agent, to navigating the agent to the families' home, until the agent delivers the package, giving the appropriate status of the delivery to the administrator.
